    <h2>About Robert P. Levy</h2>
    <p>
      Robert is the sole proprietor of Semiotic Scaffolding, LLC, a
      software development company. With over 15 years of Clojure
      software development experience, Robert specializes in
      functional and data-oriented programming and AI / machine
      learning. His strengths include designing, implementing, and
      maintaining robust and scalable systems, and solving complex
      technical challenges that demand leadership, collaboration, and
      communication skills. He has achieved success in building and
      delivering high-impact feature sets and products such as
      LLM-based summarization and ranking for malware threats at
      Cisco, a custom payouts system at Starcity, and TalkIQ's
      real-time intelligence augmentation interface for sales reps and
      customer service agents. <a href="http://rplevy.info">Read more...</a>

  <!-- ABOUT SEMIOTIC SCAFFOLDING -->
  <section class="section alt-bg">
    <h2>About Semiotic Scaffolding</h2>
    <p>
     Our philosophy of software development emphasizes functionally
     sound, maintainable, and coherent systems. We build on the
     experience of applying the data-oriented engineering and
     architecture values of Clojure and event-sourced stream
     processing.
    </p>
    <p>
     Our name comes from biosemiotics, the scientific discipline that
     studies signs and meaning-making processes within living
     systems. In biosemiotics, "semiotic scaffolding" refers to
     networks of semiotic interaction that maintain functionally
     cohesive, meaningful organization-- both at the ecological level
     and in the constitution of agents. As Jesper Hoffmeyer explains
     it, "nature in fact is not so much about “tooth and claw” as it
     is about sensing, interpreting, coordinating and social
     co-operation."
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      “Nature in fact is not so much about tooth and claw as it is about sensing,
      interpreting, coordinating and social co‑operation.”
      <span>—Jesper Hoffmeyer</span>
    </blockquote>
    <p>
     Like biological systems, modern software systems are large,
     essentially complex, and grow organically. In order to keep them
     healthy in the sense of being able to continue updating them and
     adding new functionality, we need their code to be comprensible
     and organized in ways that reinforce intentional structure, at
     both mechanical and narrative levels.
    </p>
    <p>
     This is particularly vital as we enter an era of agentic software
     in which our systems are comprised of interacting components with
     some degree of appropriately scaffolded autonomy. Programming
     skills will continue to be a valuable of knowledge for
     engineers, but increasingly there will be an additional need to
     narratively scaffold software behaviors in reliable and
     predictable ways.
    </p>
    <p>
     Whether your needs are better served by traditional software
     development or systems involving the use of generative AI,
     Semiotic Scaffolding is able to provide appropriate and
     future-proofed solutions.
